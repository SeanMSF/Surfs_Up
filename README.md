# Surfs_Up
The purpose of the analysis: To inspect climate data to determine the best time to promote surfing activities. 

Results: May, June, July and August data for 2017 are explored. While December data was requested for the challenge, it was not present in my data set! Perhaps this was to show how data sets can be problematic or incomplete in the real world..?

Three key differences in weather between June and other months:
- May has the highest variability 66-87 degrees range, 3.42 Std Dev
- June has the narrowest variablilty 71-83 degree range, 2.62 Std dev
- Temp data alone doesn't determine how to proceed. Precipitation data will be required to determine the best month to promote surfing. Good thing we can easily get it!

Summary: Data from December was not present in my data set, so it was impossible to compare (PNG file included for reference of Dec lack of data). If this was a problem with my coding, it will be corrected in the future. Only May through August data was present in the data as returned. 
For this reason, I also pulled May and August data for comparison.
